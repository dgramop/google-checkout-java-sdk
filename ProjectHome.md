This project provides a Java SDK that developers can use to integrate Google Checkout APIs in their web-applications. This SDK provides convenient Java based handlers to deal with the XML messages sent by the Google Checkout APIs notifications and callbacks.

We also provide a plugin module for the NetBeans IDE that provides a wizard driven interface to integrate the SDK in any Web project. [Here](http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-java-sdk/wiki/NetBeansModule) are instructions to download and install this NetBeans module.

This is a **Community-supported** project. Post your questions related to using this SDK under the **Java & Google Checkout API** section of the [Google Checkout Developers Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/google-checkout-developers-forum). We intend to occasionally release a minor update with bug-fixes. If you need a bug-fix urgently and can not wait for the update release, you have two options:

  1. Modify the source-code available under the project/ directory of your SDK bundle and build a new library for your use.
  1. Download the source-code from the subversion repository and build a release yourself. [Here](http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-java-sdk/wiki/EclipseProjectSetup) are the instructions on how to download and build the project from Eclipse.

You are welcome to log any bugs or suggested bug-fixes under the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-java-sdk/issues/list) page.
